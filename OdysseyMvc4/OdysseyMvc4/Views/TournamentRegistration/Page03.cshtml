    // If the JudgeId, JudgeFirstName, and JudgeLastName all exist in a single record (i.e. turn out to be a real judge), we will need to
    // redirect the client browser to Page04.  However, this does not work if we have output ANY headers by the time we try to
    // issue the redirect statement, which involves calling the header("Location:...") function.  So, we start buffering the output
    // generated by this page until we know that we are not going to redirect the client browser to another page; we can then flush
    // all of the output.
